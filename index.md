# Kanvas To Grow by Insyani Rizki
## Environmental Data Science for Sustainability
Hello! I am Insyani Rizki. Welcome to my GitHub Page. This is my portfolio of data-driven projects aimed at solving key environmental challenges. Here, I leverage data analysis, machine learning, and visualization to understand complex issues and develop actionable solutions for environmental sustainability.
**My Approach**
Each project in this portfolio follows a problem-solving framework:
* **Define the Challenge**: Isolate a specific environmental problem, from deforestation to water scarcity.
* **Analyze the Data**: Use tools like Python and SQL to clean, explore, visualize and model relevant datasets.
* **Develop the Solution**: Build predictive models, interactive dashboards, or analytical reports that offer clear, actionable insights.
